Analysis of an organisation's data is one of the common applications of data science and machine learning. It helps organisations explore their historicals analyze markets to understand their products, their competition and make recommendations on situations where products sell best. This helps to better optimize business models. This analysis is applied in recruitment, human resource management, targeted ad campaigns and a whole lot more.
For this particular project, we'll be analysing a bank marketing campaign data. Marketing campaigns usually are focused on customer needs and satisfaction. However various factors determine whether a campaign will be successful enough. Apart from the product itself, the demographic, medium for communication and price are some of the important factors. The data can be found in this link……… Here is also the description of the attributes

Term deposits are short-term loans in which the individual agrees not to withdraw the cash from the bank until a certain date agreed between the individual and the financial institution. After that time the individual gets its capital back and its interest made on the loan.

After analysis, the following conclusions were arrived at as proposed solution:
Months of Marketing Activity: For the next marketing campaign, it will be wise for the bank to focus the marketing campaign during the months of March, September, October and December. (December should be under consideration because it was the month with the lowest marketing activity, there might be a reason why December is the lowest.)
Campaign Calls: A policy should be implemented that states that no more than 3 calls should be applied to the same potential client. Remember, the more we call the same potential client, the higher the likelihood he or she will decline to open a term deposit. This might be as a result of potential client getting tired/pissed at being disturbed. It also saves us time and effort in getting new potential clients.
Age Category: The next marketing campaign of the bank should target potential clients in their 20s or younger and 60s or older. This will increase the likelihood of more term deposits subscriptions.
Occupation: Potential clients that were students or retired were the most likely to subscribe to a term deposit. Retired individuals, tend to have more term deposits in order to gain some cash through interest payments. Retired individuals tend to not spend so much of their money as responsibilities are usually reduced, so they are more likely to lend it to the financial institution. Students were the other group that used to subscribe to term deposits.
Balances: We see those potential clients on average and high balances are more likely to open a term deposit. Lastly, the next marketing campaign should focus on individuals of average and high balances in order to increase the likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit as they have more money to spare.
